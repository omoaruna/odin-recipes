    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There's no way I'm calling her by her government name. We grew up together, we were girls together.</p>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akara">Akara (Black Eyed Peas Fritters)</a> is a very delicious, vegetarian-friendly meal. It is crispy, golden, tasty, downright irresistible, and quite filling.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of peeled beans - can be black-eyed peas,white beans or light brown beans.</li>
        <li>1 big onion</li>
        <li>2 scotch bonnet chillies</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Little water to blend</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend the beans with very little water, too much water would result in flat or no akara.</li>
        <li>Incorporate air into the bean batter before frying using a whisk or wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Regulate the hotness of the oil when frying. If the oil is too hot, it will burn the bean fritters and may result in false cooking which will make the inside undercooked.</li>
        <li>Blend peeled beans with onions, scotch bonnet and water to form a thick batter.</li>
        <li>Add salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Place a frying pan on medium heat, add about 2 cups of oil and heat till hot. Test the oil by putting a tiny bit of batter in it. The oil should sizzle and batter should float on top, the oil is ready to use.</li>
        <li>Scoop batter in bits to the ready hot oil, reduce the heat and cook on each side till golden brown</li>
        <li>Repeat the process till you exhaust the whole batter.</li>
    </ol>
