    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I promise I'm no egg fanatic, they just happen to be very versatile. A freshly made egg sandwich 
    in the morning is almost like a love letter to yourself, I can shamelessly inhale these idc.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Large Eggs (this makes 2 sandwiches)</li>
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li>Avocado</li>
        <li>Sliced Cheddar Cheese</li>
        <li>Tomato Slices</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise/Butter</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the eggs:
            <ul>
                <li>In a medium bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper, whisk the eggs until they're beaten together.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Scramble the eggs:
            <ul>
                <li>Heat a non-stick pan over medium-low heat and drizzle with 2 tsp oil. Add the beaten eggs and cook until scrambled. Set aside.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Assemble the sandwiches:
            <ul>
                <li>Lay 2 slices of bread on a clean chopping board. Top with avocado, 1 slice of cheddar, half of the scrambled eggs, a second slice of cheddar, tomato slices, and finish it off with a slice of bread. Repeat with the second sandwich.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Toast sandwiches:
            <ul>
                <li>Spread the outside of your bread slices with mayonnaise. Heat a heavy bottom skillet over medium-low heat. Add the sandwiches, and toast until golden-brown and crispy, and the cheese inside is melted. Cut in half and serve.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
