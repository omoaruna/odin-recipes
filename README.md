# odin-recipes
This project displays a list of my favorite foods with links to the recipes for each of them.

The Project was assigned to me by The Odin Project. In it, I paracticed the HTML concepts that were introduced to me up until this point, concepts include:
- HTML Boilerplate
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Nested Lists
- Links (Absolute and Relative)
- Working with Images
- Writing Conventional Git Commits
- Project File Structure
