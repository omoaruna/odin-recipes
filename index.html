    <body>
        <h1>Foods that I'd be friends with If It Was Possible.</h1>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Boiled Plantain With (Nigerian Style) Fried Eggs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>She's iconic, she doesn't waste time and can be brought in at any time within a 24 hour period.</p>
       
       
            <ul>
                <li>Good Ole' Egg Sandwich.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I promise I'm no egg fanatic, they just happen to be very versatile. A freshly made egg sandwich 
            in the morning is almost like a love letter to yourself, I can shamelessly inhale these idc.</p>
       
        
            <ul>
                <li>White Rice with Boiled Beans, paired with Fried Fish.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>...Or grilled #letsbehealthy. A statement meal, well thought out, add some vegetables or stew.</p>
        
        
            <ul>
                <li>Steamed Bean Cake.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is Moi-Moi btw, just had to call her by her government name first, she's not really my FAV
            but she's a ride or die, very filling, taste like a good hug.</p>
        
        
            <ul>
                <li>Akara</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There's no way I'm calling her by her government name. We grew up together, we were girls together.</p>
